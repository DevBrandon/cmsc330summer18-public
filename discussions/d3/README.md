# Discussion 3: Oh Camel Exercises
Ungraded

## Introduction

Since there is a quiz today and a project due tomorrow there will
be no graded exercise. However, there is OCaml practice problems
in `disc.ml` and `ex.ml` that you should complete.

To run the public tests you have to compile the tests (like in C)
with `make`. Then you execute `./public.native`.
